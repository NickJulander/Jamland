 Guitar app!
  I want an web applicaiton and a web app that will help me find scale+chord progression combinations
  
  jist
    The app has a libary and the capabilities to show me what chords and scales should be paired
    You can save off chord progressions, create new ones, add reccordings???
    Everything would need to be stored and associated with some account
   
   
   Look... Let's get the guts up and running then we can take off.
   
   guts:
    Setup the database you will use
    create the template for the applicaiton
     wire the front end to the back
    login
    the rest will primarily be logic... up untill the generate chord progression part
